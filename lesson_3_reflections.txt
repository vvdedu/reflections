When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share with others, show my work, my projects. And of course, it is some kind of safety, because if my computer
or hard drive crashes, then my work still remains on the cloud :)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Good question. Maybe because if someone other made changes and push to the remote and i dont want to pull it yet.
