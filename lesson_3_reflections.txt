When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share with others, show my work, my projects. And of course, it is some kind of safety, because if my computer
or hard drive crashes, then my work still remains on the cloud :)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Good question. Maybe because if someone other made changes and push to the remote and i dont want to pull it yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: repositories on GitHub, they are only on the web (on the github servers).
Clones: they are repositories on local. Can be cloned from other local repo or from a GitHub repo.
Branches: they different versions (and commit histories) of the whole content of one repositories. So one repo can contain multiple branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is simple. If we always have the last commit from the remote, then we dont have to merge afterwards, because we make changes always from the last remote commit.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would speak with others on phone or skype all the time, always double check the mofifications and so on. I would be much harder. The pull request would be easier though, because I could simply talk with the other one about the change and if everybody agrees then i do it the changes and send it to everyone.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
It makes me easier to maintain the official version, while i can experiment on the other branch. I think ot only worths when we really need different version of the project: official, premium, experimental, etc..
